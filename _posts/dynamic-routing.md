When you go to ZMS it's easier if you expand the 1U Products before you expand the MALCs/MXKs or collapse MALCs/MXKs. They usually fail in provisioning guessing maybe due to protocol as ADSL Iâ€™m not entirely sure.
These we have to manually build the voice connections on the card and MALC. We may also need assignment to update to a compatible OE: A0660010158.

Go to prism first and select check the line card for the >> shelf management IP - make sure to select the active account at the top

Now we can search all ZMS for that "management IP"

Right click the shelf and choose >> Manage Voice Connections

Then search for the phone number just in case it's already built. If no search result >>> click the add button

## Add Like this:

- IP Interface = ipobridge-3000
- Available POTS Ports = choose the Slot and Port you want dial tone built on (screenshot shows Slot 2, Port 10)
- PLAR = Enabled
- Directory Number = Cust telephone nuumber
- User Name = tells us what VDSL shelf/card/port this cust is on

- Shelf name (change space to an underscore) + Card # (2 digits) + Port # (2 digits)
- for example, if you are on CTHTCAJK HX2 CARD 02 PORT 10, username= CTHTCAJK_HX20210
- PLAR Address = IP of the voip gateway -- see chart above
